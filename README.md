# Planning For Interview

## Learning Checklist for Required Topics

### 1. JavaScript (JS) Basics and Advanced

- [ ] Understand variables, data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null, undefined), and variable declarations (var, let, const).
- [ ] Learn operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, ternary).
- [ ] Master control structures: if/else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while, for...of, for...in).
- [ ] Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions, parameters, default values, rest/spread operators.
- [ ] Scope and hoisting: global vs. local scope, block scope, temporal dead zone.
- [ ] Arrays: methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice, map, filter, reduce, find, sort.
- [ ] Objects: creation, properties, methods, destructuring, object literals, prototypes.
- [ ] Strings: methods like concat, substring, split, replace, template literals.
- [ ] Error handling: try/catch, throw, finally.
- [ ] DOM manipulation: selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector), events (addEventListener), modifying content (innerHTML, textContent).
- [ ] Asynchronous JS: callbacks, promises (then/catch/finally), async/await.
- [ ] Modules: import/export, ES6 modules.
- [ ] JSON: parsing (JSON.parse), stringifying (JSON.stringify).
- [ ] Closures and higher-order functions.
- [ ] Event loop, call stack, and microtasks/macrotasks.
- [ ] ES6+ features: destructuring, spread/rest, classes, symbols, generators.

**Project after JS:** Build a simple To-Do List app in vanilla JS. Use DOM manipulation for adding/removing tasks, localStorage for persistence, and async functions for simulated API calls (e.g., fetch a JSON placeholder). Deploy it to GitHub Pages.

### 2. Node.js

- [ ] Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager); understand package.json and node_modules.
- [ ] Core modules: fs (file system: readFile, writeFile), path (join, resolve), os (platform info), events (EventEmitter).
- [ ] HTTP module: creating a basic server, handling requests/responses.
- [ ] Express.js basics: installation, setting up app, routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), middleware.
- [ ] Request/response handling: req.params, req.query, req.body, res.send, res.json.
- [ ] Error handling in Node: global error handlers, process.on('uncaughtException').
- [ ] Asynchronous patterns: callbacks, promises, async/await in Node.
- [ ] Environment variables: using process.env, dotenv package.
- [ ] Debugging: console.log, Node inspector, VS Code debugger.
- [ ] Clustering and scaling: using cluster module for multi-core.
- [ ] Security basics: helmet middleware, input validation.

**Project after Node.js:** Create a simple RESTful server with Express. Include endpoints for CRUD operations on a JSON file (simulating a DB). Add middleware for logging requests.

### 3. SQL Queries

- [ ] Database basics: relational DB concepts (tables, rows, columns, primary/foreign keys, normalization).
- [ ] DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, CREATE INDEX.
- [ ] DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM.

- [ ] Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, self-joins.
- [ ] Subqueries: scalar, correlated, nested queries.
- [ ] Unions: UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.
- [ ] Constraints: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT.
- [ ] Transactions: BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.
- [ ] Indexes and views: creating/using indexes for performance, CREATE VIEW.
- [ ] String functions: CONCAT, SUBSTRING, UPPER/LOWER, TRIM.
- [ ] Date functions: NOW, DATE_ADD, DATEDIFF, DATE_FORMAT.
- [ ] Window functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, OVER (PARTITION BY).
- [ ] Performance optimization: EXPLAIN, avoiding SELECT \*, indexing strategies.

**Project after SQL Queries:** Set up a local MySQL/PostgreSQL database. Write queries to manage a "blog" schema (users, posts, comments). Include complex queries like "top 5 posts by comment count" using joins and aggregates. Use a tool like phpMyAdmin or DBeaver to test.

### 4. APIs (Focusing on RESTful APIs, as it's common with Node.js/Laravel)

- [ ] API fundamentals: what is an API, REST principles (stateless, uniform interface, cacheable).
- [ ] HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS.
- [ ] Status codes: 200s (success), 300s (redirection), 400s (client error), 500s (server error).
- [ ] Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Accept.
- [ ] Authentication: Basic Auth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth basics.
- [ ] Request bodies: JSON, form-data, URL-encoded.
- [ ] API design: endpoints (e.g., /users/:id), versioning (/v1/users).
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling.
- [ ] CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): handling in servers.
- [ ] API documentation: using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- [ ] Consuming APIs: fetch API in JS, Axios library.
- [ ] Error handling: standardized error responses (e.g., {error: message}).
- [ ] Webhooks: basics of incoming callbacks.
- [ ] GraphQL basics (as an alternative to REST): queries, mutations, schemas (if time allows).

**Project after APIs:** Build a full REST API with Node.js/Express. Include authentication (JWT), CRUD endpoints, and integrate with a SQL DB (using an ORM like Sequelize). Test with Postman.

### 5. Laravel MVC

- [ ] PHP basics (if needed): variables, functions, arrays, OOP (classes, inheritance)â€”assume quick review if you know JS.
- [ ] Install Laravel: Composer, laravel new, .env setup.
- [ ] MVC structure: Models (Eloquent ORM), Views (Blade templates), Controllers.
- [ ] Routing: web.php, defining routes (GET, POST), route parameters, named routes.
- [ ] Controllers: creating, actions, dependency injection.
- [ ] Models: creating, migrations (php artisan migrate), relationships (hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany).
- [ ] Eloquent: querying (all, find, where, create, update, delete), soft deletes.
- [ ] Views: Blade syntax (@if, @foreach, @extends, @section), passing data from controllers.
- [ ] Middleware: creating, registering, groups (web, api).
- [ ] Validation: request validation, custom rules.
- [ ] Authentication: Laravel Breeze/Jetstream, guards, policies.
- [ ] Database: seeding, factories, connecting to SQL DB.
- [ ] API in Laravel: resource controllers, API routes, Sanctum for auth.
- [ ] Testing: PHPUnit basics, feature/integration tests.
- [ ] Deployment: basics like Forge or Vapor.

**Project after Laravel MVC:** Develop a simple blog app in Laravel. Use MVC: controllers for routes, models for DB interactions, views for frontend. Include user auth, post CRUD, and API endpoints for posts.

### 6. React

- [ ] React basics: installation (create-react-app or Vite), JSX syntax.
- [ ] Components: functional vs. class, props, children.
- [ ] State management: useState hook, lifting state up.
- [ ] Lifecycle: useEffect for side effects, mounting/unmounting.
- [ ] Events: handling clicks, forms (onSubmit, onChange).
- [ ] Lists and keys: rendering arrays with map, unique keys.
- [ ] Forms: controlled components, validation.
- [ ] Routing: React Router (BrowserRouter, Route, Link, useParams).
- [ ] Hooks: useContext, useReducer, custom hooks.
- [ ] Context API: providing/consuming context.
- [ ] State libraries: basics of Redux (actions, reducers, store) or Zustand.
- [ ] API integration: fetching data with fetch/Axios, handling loading/errors.
- [ ] Styling: CSS-in-JS (styled-components), Tailwind CSS basics.
- [ ] Performance: memoization (useMemo, useCallback), React.memo.
- [ ] Testing: Jest + React Testing Library basics.
- [ ] Deployment: to Vercel/Netlify.

**Project after React:** Build a frontend app that consumes your earlier Node.js or Laravel API (e.g., a dashboard for the blog). Use React Router for pages, state for user interactions, and hooks for API calls.
